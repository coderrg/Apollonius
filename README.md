The goal of this project was to be able to automatically generate asymptote code for an image.

The code in this repo is used for a service where one can upload a picture of a diagram and then get back the asymptote source code for it as well as its compiled output. Production will be updated to reflect how the convolutional neural network is being used to find intersection points which in turn allow for fitting polynomials to different curves between points in the input diagram.
